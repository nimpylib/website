## 1. Have {{<nim>}}
Since {{<pylib>}} is anyway a libary of {{<nim>}},
to use it, you shall have a nim installed:

[official install page]({{<url/nim install.html>}})

## 2. Install {{<pylib>}}

After installing {{<nim>}}, [*nimble*](
https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble#readme "nim's package manager") will be also installed.

Therefore, one command is all:

```shell
nimble install pylib
```
